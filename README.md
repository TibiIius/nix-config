# DEPRECATION NOTE

I do not use NixOS any longer as of right now. This config has been unmaintained for a while, and is most likely broken. This repository has thus been archived. Will be unarchived if I should ever return to NixOS.

If you're interested in alternative immutable systems (although NixOS's approach is far stricter), check out [my BlueBuild images](https://github.com/TibiIius/bluebuild-images).

# NixOS Configuration

My NixOS configuration files, featuring Nix Flakes aswell as Home Manager and automated Flake lockfile updates via GitHub Actions.

I currently no longer use this, but feel free to take inspiration from wherever you like.
